Run <code>sudo apt install tcl nam ns2</code>

<li>
Thats it.

<li>
<a href="https://github.com/SymphonySimper/ns-allinone-2.35">Fork of ns2 with added patch(recommended)</a>

<li>
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsnam/postdownload">ns2 latest version(source forge)</a>

<ul>
<li>
It will download the latest version of ns2 available which is <em>2.35</em>

<li>
The download file zip will be named as <em>ns-allione-2.35.tar.gz</em>

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Extract the downloaded file

<ul>
<li>
To extract the downloaded file

<ol>
<li>
Run <code>cd Downloads</code> in your terminal

<ul>
<li>
<em>Downloads</em> here refers to the directory where the file is kept
				  it may be different in your case.

</ul>
<li>
Now to extract the zip run <code>tar -xzf ns-allione-2.35.tar.gz</code>

<li>
Once the extraction is complete, run <code>cd ns-allinone-2.35</code>

<li>
Then run <code>./install</code> to install ns2

<ul>
<li>
This may take some time depeding upon your hardware as the program
				  needs to be compiled.

<li>
If everything goes well then that's it

</ul>
<li>
Now follow the steps in the output and add <span id="How to install Network Simulator 2(ns2) in unix based os?-Table of contents-Install-Compile yourself(couldn't get it to work)-PATH"></span><strong id="PATH">PATH</strong> and <span id="How to install Network Simulator 2(ns2) in unix based os?-Table of contents-Install-Compile yourself(couldn't get it to work)-LD_LIBRARY_PATH"></span><strong id="LD_LIBRARY_PATH">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</strong>

<ul>
<li>
Then source the file by running <code>source .profile</code> or <code>source .rc</code>
				  respectively.

<li>
Once that is done run <code>ns</code> to check wether the environment variables
				  are set properly.

</ul>
<li>
Now to validate your build (i.e) to check wether ns2 is properly
			   installed run <code>./validate</code>
