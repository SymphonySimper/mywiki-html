	To set time(atleas the way I like to do)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Run the following
<pre>
			echo "UTC" &gt; /etc/timezone
			emerge --config sys-libs/timezone-data
			# Now to set the correct time run the following
			# Here I'm going set time to 6:53(12h format)/ 18:53(24h format)
			# You should use 24h time format to set the time
			hwclock --set --date 18:53
			hwclock --hctosys
			rc-service hwclock restart
</pre>

<li>
Now you should be good to go

<ul>
<li>
Here <code>date</code> and <code>date -u</code> will produce the expected result

</ul>
</ul>

	I found this by accident while I was playing with <em>EndeavourOS</em> in the live environment.
As I had issues with time where I would have to settle with either wrong time in webistes(uses utc) or
my cron wouldn't work. So it was frustrating experience to say the least. I tried a lot of things but
nothing would fix this and finally when I was playing with <em>EndeavourOS</em>, it had proper time and I wanted
to know how they did and thats how I ended up with this solution.
